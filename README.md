# Smart-Medicine-Box

Polytechnic Final Year Project

This web application is part of my final year project at Ngee ann polytechnic which uses firebase authentication and real-time database. This web application is the user interface of our raspberry pi controlled smart medicine box aimed to promote medication adherence in elderly patients. Our target users are caretakers and family members of the elderly where they can use the web app to set and send alerts to the elderly to take their medication and keep track of whether the medication has been taken over the past week.

## Project Statement

## Solution Overview
### Features:
